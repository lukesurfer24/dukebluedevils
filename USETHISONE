            <p class="w3-justify">The Nantucket Shark Protection Program (NSPP) is an organization created by a group of young students on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, who are striving to make a difference in the both the local and international protection of Shark
                species. In recent years, worldwide marine ecosystems have begun to suffer and populations sizes begin to dwindle. The NSPP is a non-profit, volunteer based organization, which is made up of Nantucket locals ranging from high school
                age to adults. Using tags by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), we are setting out to gather information and various details of the sharks of the Northeast Atlantic, but most common to the inshore,
                the Sandbar/Brown Shark. Countless shark species face dangers ranging from poaching and overfishing to climate change, and the NSPP is setting out this summer to yield a better fate for these magnificent creatures.

                            and this happens around the globe. This is a macro-scale threat to our beloved oceans; each individual, however, can strive to make a change in spreading awareness or aiding small bits of reform. One can simply pick
                            up that empty soda cans on the side of the road, or that floating straw in the ocean, or that napkin that just flew away, and in these minute steps we see vast beneficial effects. If each individual can pick up one
                            piece of trash a day, the results will profoundly halt the harm we have imposed upon our environment. Inspire those around you. Strive for a future.</p>

                                <p class="w3-justify">When being introduced into the world of shark fishing, it is easy to be overwhelmed at the various options, prices, and dangers associated with it. But an all around rod and reel outfit that will cover most species
                                    and applications can actually be relatively cheap and affordable. There are several key things to consider and purchase in the art of shark fishing, and several areas for individual choice.</p>
                                <div class="w3-row w3-padding-32">
                                    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Rod and Reel Outfit</i>
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="w3-justify">When deciding which rod and reel would best fit your purpose as a shark fisherman, a few factors must be taken into account. These include the type of shark you are going after, the size, the location you will
                                        fish, the rigs/bait you will fish, the lifespan you would like it to last, and of course, lastly, your budget. In general, if you are pursuing a more aggressive species, pursuing a larger species, casting
                                        greater distances(surfcasting), or casting heavier baits/rigs, I would advise you to beef up your reel and rod choice. For a Northeast Inshore surf casting shark combo, I would recommend a 20000 size Shimano,
                                        a 8000 Penn, or a 8000 size Daiwa reel paired with a heavy/extra-heavy, fast action, rod of at least 12 feet(and no more than 15 feet). In general, if you are pursuing a smaller or more docile species of
                                        shark, fishing from a boat or casting minimal distances, using lighter bait/tackle, you would probably do better with a lighter reel choice and much shorter rod choice. For the deemed occupation, a Shimano
                                        reel of the 8000-10000 would suffice, this being a Penn or Daiwa of about 6000, and would work alongside a heavy/extra heavy, fast action, 6’-7’, rod, that preferably has a gimbal in the rod butt. Although
                                        these are just suggestions to consider, the ultimate skill and experience of the fisherman must also be taken into account, for a beginner angler may want beefier tackle than that of an experienced, hardcore
                                        angler. Additionally, for the reel choice I would recommend a reel that is built tough enough to exert at least 30 pounds of drag and hold at least 300 yards of your choice of line, and have an advanced
                                        enough drag system to sustain high pressures and heat under stress. For a beginner surfcaster combo for Nantucket, I would recommend a Shimano Spheros 20000 reel and a ugly Stik Bigwater 15’ rod.</p>

                                        <p class="w3-justify">If you already have your shark combo, or have purchased one, then the next step in your procession to catching sharks is acquiring your own bait rigs. While many tackle shops and online fishing department
                                            stores carry premade shark rigs, making your own rigs can be relatively simple, and allow for customization on behalf of the angler. For making your own rig there are basically three parts: a circle
                                            hook, attached with a haywire twist to single strand stainless steel wire, then attached with a haywire twist to a barrel swivel, attached to the other end of this barrel swivel is a thimble and crimp
                                            to connect the monofilament line and a simple fishing clip of any kind to attach your weight to, then this monofilament is connected to another thimble and crimped to a barrel swivel, and to this your
                                            braided line is tied.</p>

                                            <p class="w3-justify">When it comes to gear and terminal tackle in shark fishing, there are a few essential items to ensure safe catch and release procedures, including in the items needed for the rig. First a must have is
                                                braided line on one’s reel, preferably Power Pro Spectra Fiber Braided Fishing Line at least 50 pound test and 350 yards, and one would need a crimper to make the rigs, a crimper such as a Penn Leader
                                                Crimp with 0.1 mm-2.2 mm jaw sleeves would work with the rig above. To release the shark, one needs some form of a dehooking device such as any dehooker tool or powerful pliers, and a wire cutting
                                                tool capable of cutting the hook or atleast the wire. And then the only other equipment needed, is equipment that the average fisherman would likely have, such as fillet knives, sand spikes, and
                                                a tail rope for beginners.</p>

                                                            right techniques. It's nearly impossible to generalize into one script just simply how to catch sharks, but here are a few things to look for. In almost all cases, the fresher the bait
                                                            one can catch and use the better, and it's even better if its the local prey of sharks in that location. For boat shark fishing, if one is targeting more pelagic species such as Mako
                                                            Sharks or Thresher Sharks, chumming can be an extremely effective means to catch these sharks. For inshore shark species such as Sandbar Sharks, one would want to drift baits along the
                                                            bottom and keep baits down low there they dwell. For almost all species, moving water and currents are always a hot spot for sharks to hangout, such as inlets or heavy surf. On Nantucket,
                                                            some of my favorite surfcasting spots for Sandbar Sharks include areas where there are deeper drop offs and stronger currents, such as Great Point Light and Low Beach. The Southeast corner
                                                            of the Island features stronger currents and deeper waters than much of the rest of the island, which makes it a prime spot for the Sandbar Sharks to hangout. In areas with huge drop
                                                            offs, I generally cast my baits out only 15 yards or so and it can get the job done. In areas with shallow sandbars and surf, I tend to paddle my baits out anywhere from 50 yards to 150
                                                            yards out. But these sharks are so common, that they can be found just about anywhere on the Island, and I’ve fairly had my fair share of accidental shark encounters throughout the Island.
                                                            In terms of actually catching and landing sharks, once the bait is cast out and the rod is placed in a older of some sort, the drag should be loosened near all the way so that the shakr
                                                            cannot feel any tension when it picks up the bait. When the shark picks up the bait and the drag starts running, one must wait about 30 seconds for the shark to eat the bait, and at this
                                                            moment there is no need to dramatically set the hook and yank the rod back. Instead, one should lower the rod tip and tighten the drag, and once you feel the tension lift the rod tip
                                                            up so that the tension is secure, and the fight is on! Once the shark approaches near the beach, someone must go down towards the water's edge to grab the monofilament leader and grab
                                                            the tail of the shark, to drag it up a bit onto the sand, but MAKE SURE TO KEEP THE SHARK SUBMERGED IN THE WATER. Once here, the angler must act quickly and efficiently to unhook or cut
                                                            the leader of the shark and ensure a safe revival. One should strive to keep the shark of the water for no more than one minute, and once one is ready to release the shark, they need
                                                            to drag it by the tail into deeper water and turn it around so it’s facing out towards the sea, and hold it/push it forward until it can swim strongly.</p>

                        been an avid fisherman, starting from scup jigging and squid fishing in the harbor all the way up to beach shark fishing and tuna plugging. And after years of fishing
                        recreationally, I have decided this upcoming summer to strive to make a difference in the marine ecosystem of Nantucket. This summer I am setting out to advocate awareness
                        to protect the sharks of Nantucket, to gather data and information on the health and habits of these sharks, and to prevent the future endangerment of the Carcharhinus
                        plumbeus (Sandbar) Shark.</p>
